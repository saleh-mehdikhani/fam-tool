# Family Graph Repository

This repository contains the **relationship graph** for the family tree, generated by the [fam tool](https://github.com/saleh-mehdikhani/fam-tool).

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Do not edit files in this repository manually.**  
  The graph is automatically maintained by the `fam` tool. Manual changes may corrupt the consistency between people data and the relationship graph.

- All updates (adding/removing relationships, marriages, parent-child links, etc.) should be done via the `fam` CLI.

- This repository is tightly coupled with the **Family Data Repository**.  
  Both must stay in sync for the project to remain consistent.
